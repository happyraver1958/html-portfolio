  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm an IT professional with over twenty (going on thirty) years of experience. I've had many positions over time in big and small companies. I started as a data entry operator in my early adult life and then I kept getting promoted as my supervisors saw I was interested in IT and not just a paycheck.</p>
  <p>My greatest achievement is developing a Real Estate system from scratch based on an older, clunkier and outdated design. This project took about a year and a half and there was a lot of learning involved; I'm very happy my previous experience as a hobby developer helped a lot in understanding the concepts needed for this project. Unfortunately the company I worked for does not exist anymore but my experience remained with me and it wasn't just a challenge, it was an exciting process of learning new things and implementing them on the fly!</p>
  <p>My last job had little to do with networks, it was more about project management, developing reports based on data sets and coordinating the development of scripts to automate processes for a team. It was extremely gratifying to work with such a great team! It is probably the best company I have ever worked for!</p>
