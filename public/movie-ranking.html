  <h1>The best movies according to Liz!</h1>
  <h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>The Incredibles</h3>
  <p>
    This is my favorite animated movie by Pixar, I love the story, the nostalgia of the old times depicted and the villain is super funny!
  </p>
  <h3>The Terminator series</h3>
  <p>
    This is my favorite sci-fi movie. The story is intricate enough to be interesting but not so complex that you can't figure out what's going on. It kind of scares you into thinking that AI could take over and wipe us all out!

  <h3>The Matrix series</h3>
  <p>
    This is my second favorite sci-fi movie of all time! I love the story, it makes me think that reality might not be real which is a very interesting thought exercise.
